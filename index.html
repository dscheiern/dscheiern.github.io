          This program is intended to consider major/minor/university requirements and the student's preferences,
          such as professors, time of day, and class style, to recommend the classes in which the student should register.
          I am currently programming this specifically for Colgate University, but in the future it could be expanded to other
          universities. I am currently at the stage of deciding how to represent my data on both courses and major requirements.
          My current plan is to use two Excel files, one for all courses offered and another for each major's requirements.
