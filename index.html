          I earned both Full International Baccalaureate (IB) and Troy Tech Program Diplomas. As part of the Troy Tech program, I enrolled in computer science classes all four years, which included hands-on circuit wiring and a strong foundation in Object-Oriented Programming.
          Through the IB Program I learned how to implement the software development life cycle. I also completed 10+ page research papers in physics, math, french, philosophy, and english, and composed a research paper on quantum computing and data securtity in pursuit of my IB Diploma.

          HBIC is a school for children and adults with moderate to severe mental disabilities. This internship had very little structure,
          therefore I could make it my own. I taught myself how to use Computer Aided Design (CAD) software and built a 3D model of the
          campus, which I used to create a virtual tour. In addition to attracting new families, I celebrated graduating students by
          creating slideshow presentations. I also spent hands-on time with students, and learned how to communicate with and care for them.
          I attended Rotary Club meetings and other community network meetings with my mentor.

          For the first part of my final project, I tried to solve my favorite MLB team's pitching problems. I used a Markov
          Chain with two absorbing states, and tried to optimize the probability of being absorbed at "Win."
          For the transition probabilities, I used the concept of predator-prey models to determine which
          pitching statistics should "help" or "harm" the probability of transitioning to that state.
          For the second part of my final project, I proved the theorem that the k-step transition matrix of a Markov Chain
          is the original transition matrix raised to the kth power.
